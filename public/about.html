<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a newbie software developers and more specifically a web developer, who ocassionaly dabbles in things outside
  his own field of work mainly as a hobbie, computers have always been an important part of my life, since I've always
  been a videogame player since I was 5 years old playing in my dad's old computer.
</p>

<p>Though I may be a newbie in terms of developing software I have a good ear to the ground towards user demands as I am
  a lifelong user of both software and the internet, I've gotten to experience the changes in the design of websites
  from the infancy of websites from the early 2000s, up to the more matured websites of today.
